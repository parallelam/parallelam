# About Me

My name is Wesley Hatley, but I go by Wes.

I'm a jack of all trades with software engineering. I primarily write server side code with Node, Java with Spring Boot, and Ruby on Rails. In addition, I also work some front end, mostly with React, and to a lesser extent with Vue, Angular and jQuery.

Like my repositories, but want to see some high level architecting? Check this [Repository](https://github.com/parallelam/ArchitectPortfolio) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RwszXnoVjbXo6oje_YAMoC6-HKbxRHim?usp=sharing).

Want to hire me to work on your project? Extend a contract to me through my [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/fl/weshatley).

Want to chat about the insanity of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, quantum cryptography and the Q# language? DM me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesley-hatley/).

Just want some advice or a minimalist consultation? Shoot me an [email](mailto:weshatley@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]) with the particulars.
